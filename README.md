Project Objective: 
  - Utilize supervised machine learning to predict the class of rice grains based on their characteristics.
Data Description:
  - The dataset consists of 500 rice grain images belonging to five different species.
  - Various morphological, color, and shape features were extracted from these images for analysis.
Model Selection:
  - Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were selected for classification.
  - After hyperparameter tuning and nested cross-validation, SVM was identified as the best-performing model.
Data Exploration and Analysis:
  - Exploratory data analysis involved standardization, histograms, pairplots, and principal component analysis (PCA).
  - Feature importance analysis revealed that compactness, major axis length, and perimeter were the most significant features for classification.
